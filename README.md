# A simple introduction to pygame

This repository contains step-by-step examples demonstrating how to create basic 2D games using [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted), including:

1. Creating a game window
2. Drawing basic shapes (lines, rectangles, circles, etc.)
3. Detecting and responding to keyboard input from the player
4. Rendering text and images loaded from external files (.png, .jpeg, .gif)
5. Detecting and handling collisions between game objects
6. Moving different game entities (enemies, tokens) based on simple programming logic
7. Adjusting the speed of the game based on a consistent framerate
8. Displaying title and game over screens
9. Loading and playing music and sounds from external files (.wav, .mp3, .ogg)
10. Packaging and distributing your game in a playable web-based format

The final example demonstrates how to use [pygbag](https://pygame-web.github.io/wiki/pygbag/) to convert games developed using pygame into web-based applications playable in most modern browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, etc.). The following [playable demonstration](https://bdgiffin.github.io/pygame-tutorials/) serves as an example.
